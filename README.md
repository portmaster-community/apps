# Share of Portmaster Settings

[Portmaster from Safing](https://safing.io/) is an Application firewall with lots of configuration options. In this repo we share recommended settings (and later whole profiles) for everyone to use.

If you have a settings you want to share please create a [new discussion](https://github.com/Portmaster-Community/apps/discussions/new?category=new-profiles) so the community can discuss and together decide how to add this setting.

## [App Profiles](app-profiles/README.md)

Share settings, including fingerprints and more of a specific app with the community or go and search what the community thinks is the best Portmaster configuration. 

## [Use Case Settings](use-cases/README.md)

Share a collection of settings for specific app use case, for example for browsers, email programs or the like.

You can also use these when no one has shared a profile for you app yet.

## [Useful Global Defaults](global-defaults/README.md)

Share some useful default global settings you have created. This can be a special collection of base rules or a set of countries you have defined to be blocked.
